                <p><br>A Half Adder is a basic digital circuit that performs the addition of two binary 
                    digits, A and B, without considering any carry input. It produces two outputs: Sum 
                    (S) and Carry (C). The sum output is obtained using the XOR operation (S = A ⊕ B), while 
                    the carry output is generated using the AND operation (C = A ⋅ B). Since a half adder does not 
                    take a carry-in, it cannot be used for multi-bit addition on its own, but it serves as a 
                    fundamental building block for a full adder. Half adders are widely used in simple arithmetic 
                    circuits and digital systems requiring basic addition operations.
                    <br><br>
                    When A and B change, the half adder updates its outputs accordingly. If both inputs are 
                    different, the sum is HIGH, and the carry remains LOW. However, if both inputs are HIGH, the sum 
                    becomes LOW, and the carry output becomes HIGH, indicating an overflow to the next bit in 
                    multi-bit addition.</p><br><hr><br>

                <img src="images/xor_full.png" alt="Full Adder">
                <p><br>A Full Adder is a digital circuit that performs the addition of three binary inputs: 
                    two significant bits (A and B) and a carry-in (Cin) from a previous addition. It produces two outputs: 
                    Sum (S) and Carry-out (Cout). The sum output is determined by the XOR operation of the three inputs, while 
                    the carry-out is generated when at least two of the inputs are HIGH. A full adder can be built 
                    using two half adders and an OR gate, making it a fundamental component in binary arithmetic and
                     multi-bit addition. It is commonly used in ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units), microprocessors, and 
                     digital circuits to perform binary addition.
                    <br><br>
                    When A, B, and Cin change, the full adder updates its outputs accordingly. If an even number 
                    of inputs are HIGH, the sum is LOW; otherwise, it is HIGH. The carry-out is HIGH only when at 
                    least two of the three inputs are HIGH, ensuring proper addition in multi-bit operations.</p><br><hr><br>

                <p><br>A Multiplexer (MUX) is a digital circuit that selects one of several input signals and forwards it to a 
                    single output line based on control signals. It acts as a data selector, allowing multiple inputs to share 
                    a single communication line. A MUX has multiple inputs (2^n for n selection inputs), one output, and control
                     inputs that determine which input is routed to the output. For example, a 4-to-1 multiplexer has four inputs,
                      one output, and two selection lines to choose the active input. Multiplexers are widely used in data transmission,
                       signal routing, and memory access where multiple data sources need to be managed efficiently.
                    <br><br>
                    When the selection inputs change, the MUX switches the output to the corresponding input. If the 
                    selected input is HIGH, the output is HIGH; if it is LOW, the output is LOW. This allows seamless data 
                    transmission from multiple sources to a single destination, optimizing circuit complexity and resource
                     utilization.</p><br><hr><br>

                <p><br>A Demultiplexer (DEMUX) is a digital circuit that takes a single input signal and routes it to one of 
                    several output lines based on control signals. It acts as the reverse of a multiplexer, distributing 
                    data from one source to multiple destinations. A DEMUX has one data input, multiple output lines (2^n 
                    for n selection inputs), and control inputs that determine which output line will receive the input signal.
                     For example, a 1-to-4 demultiplexer has one input, four outputs, and two selection lines to decide the active 
                     output. DEMUX is widely used in data distribution, memory decoding, and communication systems, where a single 
                     data source needs to be directed to different locations.
                    <br><br>
                    When the selection inputs change, the DEMUX routes the input signal 
                    to the corresponding output line while keeping others inactive. If the input is HIGH, only the 
                    selected output is HIGH; otherwise, all outputs remain LOW.
